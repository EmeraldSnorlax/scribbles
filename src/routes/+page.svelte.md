## About me

I'm a barely-sentient, queer, software developer from London. I like Svelte, UI/UX, and making the web a little less shit.

In the rare event you want to refer to me, I use <span class="text-ink dark:text-chalk">they/them.</span>

See a list of my ramblings and toys [here](./articles/).
